**WARNING:** All current data on the device WILL be erased, so be sure to make full data & NANDroid backups before proceeding!

## Unlocking the device

Check out [this forum post](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/guide-oneplus-5-how-to-unlock-bootloader-flash-twrp-root-nandroid-efs-backup-and-more.548216/), rooting can be ignored as the system will be wiped fully anyways afterwards.

## Firmware & TWRP<a name="firmware-twrp"></a>

When using Sailfish OS the current port expects the phone to have Android 9 Pie firmware.

1. Fetch the files for latest O<sub>2</sub>OS 9.0.11 firmware ([OP5 / cheeseburger](https://sourceforge.net/projects/crdroid/files/cheeseburger/6.x/firmware/firmware_9.0.11_oneplus5.zip/download) | [OP5T / dumpling](https://sourceforge.net/projects/crdroid/files/dumpling/6.x/firmware/firmware_9.0.11_oneplus5T.zip/download)) and a [TWRP >=3.3.x image](https://dl.twrp.me/cheeseburger_dumpling/twrp-3.4.0-0-cheeseburger_dumpling.img.html).
2. Flash the firmware zip first and then TWRP image to Recovery partition.
3. First time flashers should also check `/data` for filesystem issues (make sure it's **unmounted** & formatted as **`ext4`** beforehand!):
```
ADB_SHELL # e2fsck /dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/userdata
```
4. Before rebooting back to recovery make sure to "Format data"!

## Flashing steps

1. Clear data & caches (factory reset)
2. Flash a recent official LineageOS 16.0 zip ([OP5 / cheeseburger](https://download.lineageos.org/cheeseburger) | [OP5T / dumpling](https://download.lineageos.org/dumpling))
3. (Optional) Flash whatever else you normally have on the Android side (e.g. [OpenGApps](https://opengapps.org/), [Magisk](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445/), [disable dm_verity & force-encrypt](https://zackptg5.com/android.php#disverfe) etc)
4. Flash your desired `sailfishos-*.zip` from the pipeline artifacts ([OP5 / cheeseburger](https://gitlab.com/sailfishos-porters-ci/cheeseburger-ci/pipelines?scope=tags) | [OP5T / dumpling](https://gitlab.com/sailfishos-porters-ci/dumpling-ci/pipelines?scope=tags)); normally takes ~1 min 30 sec)
5. Reboot

## Skipping the tutorial

Once booted for the first time Sailfish OS will always start off with a tutorial screen. Since you'll likely be flashing zips many times, this will become very annoying rather quickly. You can skip this by tapping each corner of the screen once starting from top-left going clockwise.

## Dual-booting with LineageOS

What makes SFOS unique as well is that it doesn't actually touch your `/system` partition (and `/vendor` once I figure stuff out :p), which makes it super easy to dual-boot!

When you've flashed a Sailfish OS zip you can swap between the operating systems without needing wiping anything by simply flashing my [boot-switcher zip](https://git.io/fjPUq) within TWRP.
